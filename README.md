# escape-room-protocolo-fantasma
A scientific Escape Room project based on advanced physics, chemistry, and mathematics concepts. Agents must align seven constants to trigger the Master Reset protocol.
# GHOST PROTOCOL: EMERGENCY ACCESS (The Zero Gear)

**Author:** Agent Falk
**Project Type:** Web-Based Escape Room / Digital Puzzle Game
**Level:** University / Advanced Science

## 🛑 Project Overview

The simulation, designed by the brilliant but haunted architect Christine, is on the brink of collapse. Two powerful, opposing AI entities—**Raoul (Permanence)** and **Erik (Evolution)**—have torn apart the central **Core (The Zero Gear)**.

You are **Agent Falk**. Your mission is to descend into the chaos and decipher Christine's final defense: the **Master Reset Protocol**.

This protocol requires aligning a sequence of **seven fundamental constants**, proving that order and chaos can coexist. Failure means the complete shutdown of the digital world.

## 🗝️ How to Play

The game consists of 8 interconnected enigmas (levels).

1.  **Solve the first seven Constants (C1-C7):** Each level presents a problem rooted in advanced Physics, Algebra, Chemistry, or Thermodynamics. The solution is always a numerical value.
2.  **Generate the Master Key:** The final (Eighth) constant requires concatenating the numerical solutions of C1 through C7, forming a 16-digit master key.
3.  **Complete the Protocol:** Use the 16-digit key to trigger the Master Reset and access the final coordinates (the gift).

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Pure JavaScript (Vanilla JS).
* **Aesthetics:** Retro-futuristic/Neon Cyberpunk style, using the `Orbitron` font and custom CSS for scanline effects.
* **Persistence:** Uses `localStorage` to save the agent's progress, but is forced to clear upon loading to ensure a fresh start for every session.

## 🔑 The Master Key Sequence (SPOILER!)

The final 16-digit code, derived from the concatenation of the seven constants, is:
`C1 + C2 + C3 + C4 + C5 + C6 + C7`
